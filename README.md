# oop-project-rental

This was an object oriented programming project in the fourth semester of university.

The brief was to create a library style application with a functional login system (with two types of user accounts) that has different types of objects to loan. Please see the wiki for more information on the project and some reflection.

The requirements I adapted from the generic ones were as follows:

- The system must be able to handle multiple types of vehicles, namely motorcycles, cars, vans and trucks.
- The system must show the current number of vehicles and the current number of each type of vehicle available to be rented.
- The system must be able to mark vehicles as currently rented/loaned and show the start and end dates of the current rental contract.
- The system must be able to mark vehicles as having been returned and put them back into the list of available vehicles.
- The system should be able to print information about a single vehicle to a file including the details about the vehicle, whether it is available and the start and end dates of the current rental period.
- The system must allow the user to search for an item by any of its details.
- The system must have a functional login system with two different types of account, standard and administrator.
- The application must have the ability to register a new account through the graphical user interface.
- The system should allow administrators to review and approve or deny newly registered user accounts.
